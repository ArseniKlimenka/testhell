# Files for Postman

We have Postman collections in folder [collections](./collections). It contains some basic examples of API calls. Feel free to add more of them.

It is using **environments** and OAuth2 authentication so you should not have much manual work to get started.

OAuth2 token is configured on the level of each collection.

In [environments](./environments) folder are Postman environments used on our implementation. It contains variables for server and authorization URL. Feel free to add more of them.

**How to start:**

* Import collection to postman
* Import environment to postman
* "Get New Access Token" token in collection and press "Use Token"
* Select request from collection, be sure that correct environment is selected (top-right corner)
* Start making requests
